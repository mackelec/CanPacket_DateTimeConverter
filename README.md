# CanPacket_DateTimeConverter

## Overview

The `CanPacket_DateTimeConverter` is an Arduino library that serves a specialized purpose: converting the compile date and time of your Arduino sketch into an 8-byte CAN message. This becomes incredibly useful in scenarios where you want to timestamp a compiled sketch or need to validate firmware versions based on their compile time.

Additionally, the library offers the functionality to decode a CAN message generated by this library back into a human-readable date and time.

Upon instantiation, the class initializes itself with the compile date and time, making it immediately ready for conversions without any additional setup.

## CAN Packet Structure

The 8-byte CAN packet is structured as follows:

```
[0] - Years since 2000
[1] - Month (1-12)
[2] - Day (1-31)
[3] - Hour (0-23)
[4] - Minute (0-59)
[5] - Second (0-59)
[6] - Reserved
[7] - Reserved

```
The reserved bytes [6] and [7] could be leveraged for future enhancements or to store additional information if needed.

## Key Commands

Here are the primary commands you'd use:

- **Initialization**: When you create an instance of the `CanPacket_DateTimeConverter` class, it automatically sets itself with the compile date and time.
  
  ```
  CanPacket_DateTimeConverter converter;
  ```
- **Set Date-Time Manually**: If you wish to manually set the date and time, use the `setDateTime` method. This becomes useful in scenarios where the compile time isn't of interest.

  ```
  converter.setDateTime("Dec 25 2023", "12:34:56");
  ```
- **Convert to Strings**: If you wish to obtain the date and time in a string format from the CAN packet structure, use the `toStrings` method.

  ```
  char dateStr[12];
  char timeStr[9];
  converter.toStrings(dateStr, timeStr);
  ```
